A custom skin for Ragnarok Online

## Usage
To apply a skin:
1. Place `test001` folder into your client's `Skin` folder
2. Login into the game 
3. ESC -> Game Settings (2nd top option) -> Select **test001** 

## Warning 
This skin is meant for 2020+ clients and it may get updated eventually for newer versions. 

## Todo or not todo
1. Planning to do:
   + [ ] Add a screenshot to Git page 
   + [ ] Add new jobs party icons 
   + [ ] Replace Kafra tabs with textless symbols? 
2. Not Gonna Do:
   *See Notes section*
3. Not changeable through skin:
   * Equipment Swap set background
   * Character selection 
   * Rodex 
   * Laphine combination 
   * Enchant interface 
   * Equip preview 
   * NPC dialogue window's background color and menu colors 
   * Quest window's quest description text background color
4. I'd do if I knew how: 
   - Background color in card comparison iteminfo 
   - Vending title 

## Notes
* I don't plan translating any buttons as they are all messed up (some are just images, those are translatable with skin, and some are plain button image with text from other sources--those are not)
* I don't plan to support older clients 
* I may eventually come up with better name for it
