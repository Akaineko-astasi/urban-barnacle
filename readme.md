A custom skin for Ragnarok Online

## Usage
To apply a skin, place `test001` folder into your client's `data/Skin` folder, then login into the game and select **test001** in the game options.

## Known bugs on 2021 clients
1. In the NPC dialogue window, background color is not applied
2. In the Quest Window, description text background color is not applied
3. Swap Equipment window background is not applied
4. Jobs icons are not applied in the character selection window

## Notes
* Some elements are in Russian and some are in English. I don't know if I'll ever translate them or not and into what (probably eng)
* I may eventually come up with the better name for it
